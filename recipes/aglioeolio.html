    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>
        This late-night Roman staple is astonishingly full-flavored. Start the water before you do anything else, because the sauce takes less than 10 minutes start to finish.
    </p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Salt</li>
        <li>2 to 3 whole fresh peperoncini (small red chiles), or small dried red chiles</li>
        <li>⅔ cup extra virgin olive oil</li>
        <li>4 garlic cloves, thinly sliced</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon olive oil</li>
        <li>¼ cup chopped Italian parsley</li>
        <li>¾ pound linguine or spaghetti</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Put a pot of salted water on to boil. Remove the stems of the peperoncini, halve them lengthwise, then slice them into ¼-inch lengths. Put the oil, garlic and peperoncini in a large deep pan set over medium-high heat, and cook until the garlic is translucent and golden, 2 to 3 minutes. Add the parsley to the pan, and turn off the heat.</li>
        <li>Meanwhile, cook the pasta until it is aldente, nearly but not quite done and still a bit chalky in the middle. Drain, and reserve 1 cup of the cooking liquid.</li>
        <li>When the oil has cooled for a couple of minutes, add ½ cup of the pasta cooking water, and reduce over high heat by about half. Add the pasta, and stir vigorously as it continues to cook. Add the reserved pasta water a bit at a time as necessary to finish cooking the pasta, and develop the thickened sauce. Season with salt, and serve.</li>
    </ol>
